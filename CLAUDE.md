# Salty's Cabinet — coin collection app

Personal coin collection app for Ray Ayres ("Salty"). Static site on GitHub Pages,
no backend server. Talks directly to OneDrive (Ray's personal Microsoft account) via
Microsoft Graph API, and the Excel workbook there is the authoritative data store.

## Maintenance
Update this file only when something changes that a future session would actually
need to know to avoid re-doing work or making a wrong assumption — a new
architectural decision, a schema/naming convention change, a scope boundary, or a
change to how a feature is supposed to work. Don't update it for routine task
completions (a bug fix, a component built to existing spec, a screen finished per
existing spec) — just do the work. If unsure whether something rises to that bar,
ask before updating rather than updating by default.

## Hard constraints
- Free tier only. No paid Azure resources, no third-party automation platforms.
- No backend server — static HTML/JS + Microsoft Graph API only.
- Excel workbook in OneDrive stays the source of truth, co-managed with Microsoft
  Copilot in separate Excel sessions between coding sessions.
- Mobile-first — Ray mainly uses a Samsung S25 on Samsung Internet, which has real
  browser quirks (see below). Desktop/tablet also matter, especially for Albums.

## Current live files
- `salty224.github.io/coin-collection-app/` — GitHub Pages root
- `index.html` — original connection test page (sign in / read / write test)
- `stage.html` — working "Add New Coin" staging form (photo capture → OneDrive
  Staging folder). Confirmed working end-to-end. **Do not break this.**

## Azure / Entra config
- Client ID: `bf9aaf28-a5e1-4eed-a006-15f03146693b`
- Tenant: `consumers` (personal Microsoft accounts only)
- Authority: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers`
- MSAL: use `loginRedirect`, not popup (popup breaks on mobile after a canceled
  attempt). Load MSAL from jsdelivr CDN, not the default Microsoft CDN
  (`alcdn.msauth.net` is silently blocked by a browser extension Ray has).
- Redirect URIs must be registered per page/route in Entra.

## OneDrive folder structure
```
CoinCollection/
  CoinPhotos/            named {CollectionID}_obverse.jpg, _reverse.jpg, and (only if a
                           3rd/4th image is actually needed — slab label closeup, box,
                           etc.) _photo3.jpg, _photo4.jpg. Flat — no subfolder by
                           year/series/anything else.
  CoinReceipts/           named {CollectionID}_receipt.jpg, or timestamp-named for
                           batch receipts not yet tied to a coin
  Staging/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}/   fallback landing zone when a direct Excel write fails
                                 — data.json + generic-named photos, collectionID left
                                 blank until reconciled
  CoinCollection (AI).xlsx
```
- **Upload naming** (Ray's side — no suffix typing, just what the app captures):
  `{CollectionID}_obverse.jpg` / `_reverse.jpg` / `_combined.jpg`.
- **Combined obverse+reverse in one image** (some PCGS TrueView shots, some seller
  photos): file the raw upload as `{CollectionID}_combined.jpg` in the Photo3 slot
  (Photo4 if Photo3 is already taken by something else) — supersedes the same-day
  decision that filed it as `_obverse.jpg`; don't build against that older version.
- **Crop commit (final, locked in) — automatic renaming, Ray never types a
  filename himself**: once the crop tool runs (on a normal obverse/reverse upload,
  or on a combined image — see below), the app:
  1. Preserves the untouched input as `{CollectionID}_obverse_original.jpg` (or
     `_reverse_original.jpg`) — **never deleted**.
  2. Writes the baked/cropped result as `{CollectionID}_obverse_cropped.jpg` (or
     `_reverse_cropped.jpg`).
- **No dedicated splitter tool for combined images.** Cropping a `_combined.jpg`
  into separate obverse/reverse files is just the existing single-photo crop tool
  run twice against the same `_combined.jpg` source — once framing the obverse
  region, once the reverse region. Output: `_combined_original.jpg` (preserved),
  `_obverse_cropped.jpg`, `_reverse_cropped.jpg`. Once both cropped files exist,
  update Obverse/Reverse per the display rule below and clear the "combined, not
  yet cropped" Remarks note.
- **Display rule (locked in): Obverse/Reverse should never be blank once a photo
  has been uploaded for that slot.**
  - Immediately on upload, before any crop exists: point to the `_original` file
    (shows the raw/uncropped photo — not ideal in the circular frame, but better
    than no photo at all).
  - Once the crop tool runs and a `_cropped` file exists: the column
    automatically switches to point there instead. Cropped always wins once it
    exists.
  - If a crop is ever deleted/reset: falls back to `_original` again rather than
    going blank.
- **New All-sheet columns: `Obverse_Original` and `Reverse_Original`**, positioned
  directly after `Obverse` and `Reverse`. They always hold the original filename
  regardless of crop state (so Ray can locate/re-crop an original later without
  hunting OneDrive by hand); `Obverse`/`Reverse` hold whichever filename is
  currently *displayed* (original or cropped, per the rule above).
- **This whole feature depends on the Graph API write layer being built first —
  none of it functions until that exists.** Confirmed: every Save button in the
  app is currently a stub (Add Coin, Browse Edit, Wishlist, Batch Receipt all just
  toast "nothing saved yet") — no OneDrive writes happen anywhere in the app yet.
  When that write layer gets built, this naming/renaming/fallback logic is what
  it needs to implement — not a separate future feature on top of it.

## ID schemes (locked in)
- CollectionID: `AY-#####` (5-digit). Parent rows get `-Set` suffix; child rows get
  `-A`/`-B`/etc. **This suffix pattern is reserved exclusively for
  acquisition/provenance lineage — never repurpose it for anything else.**
- CoinID: custom `C-YYYY-M-DDD-##`. Meant to be unique per DB_Coins row (one row
  per coin type/variant), but **this has only been audited for the ~326 DB_Coins
  rows tied to currently-owned coins, not all ~3,753 rows** — a real duplicate-
  CoinID row was already found and fixed once (2019-W Lincoln Cent Proof vs.
  Reverse Proof shared `C-2019-W-1C-01` until split). Don't assume CoinID
  uniqueness holds across the full DB_Coins table until the wider audit is done;
  don't build caching/indexing logic on that assumption without a way to detect
  a collision. (This is a different situation from `PCGS_Duplicate_Queue` below —
  that's an *expected, handled* collision on a different column, PCGS#.)
- SetID: custom `S-XXYY-TT-##`
- SerNo (on All sheet): the PCGS/NGC **cert number alone** (not combined with the
  type/PCGS# — those are separate values; see PCGS Label Auto-Populate below for how
  a scanned label splits into its parts).

## Workbook naming conventions
- **Column headers have no spaces**, across DB_Coins, DB_Sets, All, and Albums —
  e.g. `MintMark`, `SerNo`, `CertLink`. Match this exactly when reading/writing via
  the Graph Excel API; a header with a space is stale.
- **Denomination values are short codes**, not full words: Cent → `1C`, Nickel →
  `5C`, Dime → `10C`, Quarter → `25C`, Half Dollar → `50C`, Dollar → `$1`. Any
  denomination dropdown/display in the app should use (or map to/from) these codes.

## Workbook sheets that matter
- **All** — owned coin records, ~480 rows. Authoritative for what Ray owns. Has a
  new **SpotValue** column (not live yet — formula pending).
- **DB_Coins** — ~3,753 reference coin types. Add rows opportunistically when a gap
  is hit during other research — never proactively expand into an exhaustive catalog.
  Has Mintage (partially populated) and will get a new FunFact column. Co-managed
  with Copilot outside app sessions (GSID population, PCGS# corrections, structural
  fixes have happened this way) — **treat any previously-pulled copy of DB_Coins as
  possibly stale**; re-pull before relying on it for anything beyond a quick mockup.
- **DB_Sets** — reference sets, including all albums (Type=AL).
- **Albums** (formerly AlbumSlots) — restructured; actual live columns are
  `Status`, `Year`, `MintMark`, `Description`, `AlbumName`, `AlbumID`, `CoinID`,
  `FilledBy` (plain CollectionID, blank = open hole/want-list). There is no
  SlotLabel/SlotCriteria/SlotYear/SlotMint — Year/MintMark are used directly, and
  **CoinID is what actually disambiguates two slots that share the same
  Year+MintMark** (e.g. a plain date vs. its VDB-type variety) — don't assume
  Year+MintMark alone is a unique key for a slot.
- **Wishlist** (new) — freestanding want-list items not tied to any album:
  Description, Notes, Target Price, Date Added.
- **DB_Rolls** (new) — separate table, not part of the main coin data. Not needed
  for the app shell yet.
- **ProjectPlan** and **ParkingLot** — the authoritative source of decisions and open
  items, date-stamped with row/column references. ParkingLot Status is now three
  states: Open / In progress / Resolved (+ Resolved Date). Default review filter
  shows Open + In progress only.

## Add Coin: the core workflow
1. Camera/library capture (existing pattern: separate 📷 Camera and 🖼️ Library
   buttons per photo slot — required for Samsung Internet, which skips the native
   chooser dialog).
2. Review/confirm screen before save.
3. **Direct write attempt**: assign next CollectionID, write row to the All table via
   the Graph Excel API, save photos into CoinPhotos named with that CollectionID —
   all in one step. CollectionID is only ever assigned at the exact moment the Excel
   write also succeeds — never assigned speculatively.
4. **Fallback**: if the write fails (workbook locked elsewhere, etc.), fall back to
   the existing Staging folder pattern instead — timestamp folder, generic photo
   names, blank collectionID. Nothing lost.
5. **Reconciliation** (assign ID → write Excel row → rename/move photos out of
   Staging into CoinPhotos/CoinReceipts → delete staging folder) is one shared
   function — runs instantly on save in the normal case, or later via a "pending
   coin" retry banner on the dashboard, which checks the Staging folder on load.
6. Batch orders / multi-coin receipts are explicitly OUT of scope for the app —
   that stays a Claude-chat + Copilot-paste workflow. The app's only role there is
   the "Batch receipt" capture action below.

### Add Coin field layout (locked in)
Top level is only what's needed to identify the coin and describe the specific
slab — everything else is one level down. Partial purchase data (e.g. a price with
no seller/shipping context) isn't useful on its own, so those fields stay bundled
together rather than mixed in at the top level.
- **Top level**: Obverse/Reverse photos (optional to fill, but the slots are always
  shown), Denomination (coded dropdown — see naming conventions), Year, Mint Mark,
  Description, Variety, Grade, GradeSource, Cert/Type Number (SerNo), Designation,
  Error, Notes.
- **Error** (new field) is distinct from Variety and Designation — it's for mint
  errors (off-center strike, broadstrike, wrong planchet, etc.), not cataloged
  varieties or grading-service qualifiers. Optional, usually blank.
- **Description vs. Variety are separate fields, matching the existing Excel
  columns** (not a schema change): Description is the series/design name (e.g.
  "Mercury (Winged Liberty)"); Variety is the true distinguishing feature (e.g.
  "Type 2", "Micro S", "Large Date"). Don't conflate them back into one field.
- **GradeSource** is a dropdown sourced from `Lookup_Graders` (`PCGS`, `NGC`,
  `ANACS`, `ICG`, `CAC` — whatever's in that table) plus three fixed
  non-certified options: `Seller` (taking the seller's word for it), `Owner`
  (own best estimate), `AI-est` (AI-assisted estimate). No separate
  "raw/ungraded" value — leave Grade blank for that. **Superseded decision:**
  GradeSource used to be a separately-hardcoded shorter list (PCGS/NGC only,
  explicitly "a different list" from the certification-service options) — that
  split was removed so picking a Grader (see PCGS Label Auto-Populate below)
  can set GradeSource directly without the two lists disagreeing on what's
  valid.
- **Secondary, collapsed by default — Purchase Info**: Purchase Price, Shipping
  Cost, Purchase Date, Vendor/Seller, Receipt photo.
- **Secondary, collapsed by default — Storage & Album**: Storage Location, Assign
  to Album (which album + which open slot), Additional photo.
- **Interaction pattern for the two secondary sections is drill-down, not an
  inline accordion**: tapping "Purchase Info" or "Storage & Album" replaces the
  top-level fields with just that section's fields (a back link returns to the
  top level). Once filled in and closed, the row shows a one-line summary of
  what was entered (e.g. "$45.00 · eBay seller") instead of the raw fields, so
  the top level stays short.
- **Coin photo previews (Obverse/Reverse/Additional — not Receipt) render
  circular**, matching the Spotlight/Browse coin discs so they read as a coin
  rather than a square photo.
- **Manual pan/zoom/rotate crop adjuster (locked in)**: picking/taking a photo for
  a circular slot opens an adjuster — drag to reposition, slider to zoom
  (100–300%), bounded so the photo can't be panned past its own edges. Two 90°
  quick-rotate buttons handle a sideways/upside-down capture; a separate
  "Straighten" slider (±45°) handles a fine tilt correction on top of that. "Use
  Photo" bakes the result (pan + zoom + rotation) into an actual cropped image
  (canvas, fixed output resolution) rather than keeping a live CSS crop, so it
  displays correctly regardless of frame size (Obverse/Reverse resize with
  Denomination). A small "adjust crop" icon button next to Camera/Library reopens
  the adjuster on the same original photo afterward — not a one-shot,
  first-pick-only thing. Reopening always resets to the original framing
  (doesn't resume the last adjustment, including rotation). This is still manual,
  user-driven placement, not smart edge detection — real auto-detection/AI
  cropping is out of scope (see "What NOT to build").
- **The baked crop is display-only right now — nothing is written back to
  OneDrive.** The "Use Photo" canvas bake produces a real cropped image, but it
  only ever becomes a browser-local Blob URL, live in that one page load; it
  isn't saved to localStorage (deliberately — see "What NOT to build") or
  uploaded anywhere. Reload the page, or open the same coin on another device,
  and the crop is gone — this is true whether the adjustment happens during Add
  Coin or later via Browse Edit's "reopen adjuster." This isn't a gap specific
  to the crop tool — it's the same underlying gap as every other Save button in
  the app (Add Coin, Browse Edit, Wishlist, Batch Receipt all currently just
  toast "nothing saved yet"): no real OneDrive/Graph API write layer exists
  anywhere yet. Once that write layer gets built, the crop-commit/original-
  preservation/display-fallback behavior is fully spec'd — see the crop
  commit / display rule under "OneDrive folder structure" above — not an open
  question anymore.
- **Splitting a combined image into two files uses the existing single-photo
  crop tool, unchanged — no dedicated splitter tool.** Run it twice against the
  same `_combined.jpg` source (once for the obverse region, once for reverse);
  see "OneDrive folder structure" above for the resulting filenames and the
  Obverse/Reverse update that follows.
- **Obverse/Reverse show one at a time via a small toggle**, not stacked and
  not side by side — a dot on each toggle button lights up once that side has
  a photo. This keeps the bigger circle/bigger corner-label text (legible
  without glasses) without the page getting long from showing both full-size
  cards at once. Camera/Library controls are small quiet icon-only circles
  below the photo, not full-width labeled buttons — the coin is the focal
  point, the controls aren't.
- **Coin discs/photos scale by denomination** — proportional to real coin
  diameters (a dime is genuinely smaller than a cent, which is smaller than a
  nickel/quarter/half/dollar), floored at 70% of max size so nothing goes
  illegibly tiny on a phone. Applies everywhere a coin renders at a readable
  size: Browse grid, Spotlight, Browse detail, and Add Coin's obverse/reverse
  frames (which resize live as Denomination changes).
- **Mint Mark is a dropdown** (blank/Philadelphia, D, S, CC, O, W), not free
  text.
- **Year has an optional decade-drill-down picker** alongside the plain text
  field — tap a decade (1790s-2020s), then a year within it, so picking a
  year is never one giant scrolling list. Typing the year directly still
  works exactly as before; the picker is additive.

### Coin-flip corner labels (locked in)
Text overlays in the open corner space around a coin's circular photo/disc,
styled like a collector's handwriting on a 2x2 flip (Caveat font, straight
horizontal — no rotation) — so the digital record and the physical flip carry
the same info in the same positions. This applies in two places, both using
the same corner mapping:
- **Add Coin (live entry)**: labels update live as the top-level fields are
  filled in. The underlying form fields stay the actual source of truth —
  this overlay never replaces them.
- **Saved-coin views (Dashboard Spotlight, Browse detail)**: once a coin is
  saved, its info is presented ON the photo as corner labels **instead of** a
  text block underneath — the photo is the display. A screen-reader-only
  summary (`.sr-only`, visually hidden) carries the same info as plain text
  so it isn't lost for accessibility; the visible corner spans are
  `aria-hidden`. Small grid/thumbnail views (Browse's grid) keep simple plain
  text instead — labels wouldn't be legible at that size.
- **The flip-frame is capped at a fixed max size (280px square)**, not
  stretched to the container width, so the coin stays proportional to an
  actual 2x2 flip (coin centered, real margin around it) instead of looking
  tiny in an overly wide box on desktop.
- **Obverse is identification only — standard numismatic shorthand**:
  top-left Year+MintMark (`1945-S`); top-right the coded Denomination only
  (`10C`, not the spelled-out series name — the full name stays available
  elsewhere: Browse detail heading, Browse grid, sr-only text); bottom-left
  Grade+GradeSource (`MS-67 PCGS`); bottom-right Variety+Designation combined,
  if present (`Micro S, FB`).
- **Reverse (Add Coin only — saved coins don't yet track Error/Price
  separately from the obverse display)**: only two conditional items —
  top-left Error, if set; bottom-right Purchase Price, if set (`$45.00`).
  Denomination/Grade shorthand are real ANA/Red Book conventions; this
  front/back split itself is **not** an official numismatic standard (none
  exists) — it's Ray's own preference, matching the price-sticker placement
  he sees at his local coin shop.

### Browse detail view (locked in)
Browse is a grid-then-detail pattern (same shape as Albums): tapping a grid card
opens a full detail view for that coin with the flip-label treatment above, plus
a back link. Below the flip-frame, a **grade/cert badge** shows Grade +
GradeSource + cert number as one pill; the whole badge is a link (opens the
cert lookup URL via the grader-agnostic `Lookup_Graders` resolver — see PCGS
Label Auto-Populate below) when that GradeSource has a base URL on file, plain
text otherwise. No separate cert-link line. An **Edit** button on the detail
view opens an edit form covering exactly the bounded fields the app can safely
write directly (see "Editing existing coins" below: Grade, GradeSource,
Cert/Type Number, Designation, Storage Location) plus the ability to attach a
photo to any Obverse/Reverse/Additional/Receipt slot that wasn't filled during
Add Coin — reusing the same photo-slot/crop-adjuster module. In Edit mode the
same cert number is a compact pill-styled input (not a full-width labeled
field) with a small link-icon button beside it, visually matching the
read-only badge. Editing does **not** cover anything requiring research or
judgment (album/slot re-matching, cost allocation, new catalog lookups) — that
stays a chat + Copilot task, same boundary as before. "Back" from Edit returns to
the coin's Detail view, not the grid.

### Browse: Grid/List toggle (locked in)
A small icon toggle (grid icon / list icon) next to the filter row switches the
coin listing between the existing card grid and a plain list-row layout. Both
reuse the exact same card markup — list mode is a CSS rearrangement rather than
a separate render path, so the two stay in sync automatically. List mode drops
the coin thumbnail entirely (reclaims row width) and enlarges Year+MintMark so
it reads as the dominant, immediately-scannable element per row, with the coin
name and CollectionID secondary. The chosen mode persists across filter changes
within a Browse session.

### Browse filters (locked in)
One filter row, single-select (only one chip active at a time, same interaction
as before): `All / Cents / Nickels / Dimes / Quarters / Halves / Dollars` (by
Denomination), then a thin divider, then `Sets / Medals / Commemoratives`. All
in the top row — no hidden "More Filters" drawer; an earlier draft of this tried
tucking Set/Commemorative into a collapsed panel and that was explicitly wrong,
Ray wants them visible up top even though the row now needs horizontal scroll on
phone widths.
- **Sets is a picker of actual set entities, not a coin filter.** Tapping "Sets"
  replaces the coin grid with a list of named sets (e.g. "2021 Silver Proof
  Set") — a new **DB_Sets-style entity** distinct from a coin's own Set field,
  each with a type (`Mint Set`/`Proof Set`/`Silver Proof Set`), a year, and the
  specific coins that belong to it. Tapping a set shows just its member coins
  (reusing the same grid/list rendering and Grid/List toggle), with its own back
  link to the Sets picker. This replaced an earlier, explicitly-corrected version
  that filtered individual coins down to "any coin tagged with a Set type" —
  Ray's correction: clicking Sets should show sets, not coins. The Grid/List
  toggle and denomination chip row are hidden while the Sets picker itself is
  showing (nothing to toggle), and reappear once you're inside a specific set.
- A coin's own **Set field** (blank / `Mint Set` / `Proof Set` / `Silver Proof
  Set`) still exists on the All sheet and still says which aggregate category a
  coin belongs to — it's just no longer what the "Sets" chip filters by. It's
  what a specific DB_Sets-style entity's member coins would have in common.
- **Medals**: a new **item type** (new All-sheet field, `coin` vs. `medal`),
  not just a filter tag — medals aren't coins (no denomination, not necessarily
  graded the same way) but do live in the same Browse list.
- **Commemoratives**: matches a new boolean-ish All-sheet field.
- **Set, Medals, and Commemoratives are not mutually exclusive with each other or
  with Denomination in the underlying data** — a coin can be both part of a Set
  and a Commemorative (e.g. a commemorative sold packaged in a proof set, demoed
  by one coin appearing under both the Commemoratives filter and inside a named
  set in the Sets picker). The single-select chip only picks which lens you're
  looking through right now; it doesn't imply the categories can't overlap.
- Flagged-but-not-built for a future filter dimension: metal/composition
  (Silver/Copper/Nickel/Clad/Gold — not always obvious from denomination alone).
  Also flagged: half dimes / three-cent pieces will need their own Denomination
  code once catalogued (`5C` is already the modern nickel, so a half dime can't
  reuse it) — not decided yet, deal with it when the first one is catalogued.

### Grade picker (locked in)
Grade is a dropdown built from Lookup_Grades (Circulated / Mint State / Proof &
Specimen / Details & Problem Grades groups), not free text. Two extra modes on top
of a plain single pick:
- **Range/combine**: a checkbox reveals a second "to" grade dropdown (standard
  grades only, no Details/Problem/Other); picking two combines them into one
  value, e.g. Good (`G-4`) + Very Good (`VG-8`) → `G-4-VG-8`.
- **Other**: reveals free text for edge cases the standard list doesn't cover.
- **Standard: all numeric coin grades use a hyphen between the letter prefix and
  the number** (`MS-63`, not `MS63` or `MS 63`; `VF-20`, not `VF20`) — this
  applies to the Grade field everywhere in the app and to the PCGS Label
  Auto-Populate parser below. Designation (FB, RD/RB/BN, CAM/DCAM) is a separate
  field and is never appended to the Grade string.

### Description auto-fill (locked in)
Once Year + Denomination are both entered, Description auto-fills from
Ref_Denominations (year range → series name per denomination), e.g. 1920 + Dime
→ "Mercury (Winged Liberty)". Stays editable — once the user types into
Description directly, later Year/Denomination edits stop overwriting it (won't
clobber a manual correction for transition years/edge cases).

### DB_Coins soft match (locked in)
Once Year + Denomination are filled in (Mint Mark and Variety are used in the
match key as-is, including blank — most DB_Coins rows have no notable variety),
soft-check against DB_Coins:
- **Match** → auto-pull and show CoinID, PCGS#, Mintage.
- **No match** → do NOT hard-block. Show a clear, non-blocking warning ("No
  matching DB_Coins entry — coin will still be added, but needs a catalog entry
  added later") and let the coin proceed to get its **CollectionID** immediately.
  DB_Coins isn't meant to be exhaustive, so blocking would sometimes be wrong,
  not just annoying.
- **CoinID vs. CollectionID are different IDs and follow different rules.**
  CollectionID (ownership tracking, `AY-#####`) is still assigned only at
  successful Excel write, per the core workflow above — a DB_Coins miss doesn't
  change that. CoinID (the DB_Coins reference key) is what's allowed to stay
  blank/pending on a miss.

### Grader dropdown + grader-agnostic cert linking (locked in)
A **Grader** dropdown (Add Coin, above the label-entry field; sourced from
`Lookup_Graders` — `PCGS`/`NGC`/`ANACS`/`ICG`/`CAC`) sits above the PCGS Label
field and drives three things when picked:
1. Sets **GradeSource** to match (see GradeSource note above — same list now).
2. Decides whether the label-entry field shows at all: only `PCGS` has a
   confirmed auto-decode format, so picking `PCGS` reveals the "PCGS Label #"
   field; picking any other grader hides it and shows a plain note instead
   ("no auto-decode for this grader yet — enter manually below"), per the
   ANACS/ICG/CAC research note further down.
3. Enables the cert-lookup link once a cert number is present, using
   `Lookup_Graders[GradeSource].Cert Lookup Base URL` — **grader-agnostic**, not
   hardcoded per service. Adding a new confirmed grader to `Lookup_Graders`
   (a base URL) is the only change needed to light up its lookup link; no code
   change per grading service. The link only activates if that GradeSource
   actually has a base URL on file (today: PCGS and NGC do, ANACS/ICG/CAC don't
   — see the research note).

This same base-URL lookup is also what powers the Cert/Type Number field's
link everywhere else in the app (Browse detail's read-only badge, Browse
Edit) — one resolver, not a PCGS-specific one repeated in multiple places.

**Cert/Type Number display pattern**: a compact input + a small link-icon
button beside it (button only visible when a lookup URL resolves), not a
separate full-line hyperlink underneath — this applies in Add Coin and Browse
Edit. Browse's read-only coin detail view goes one step further and folds
Grade + GradeSource + cert number into a single pill-shaped badge; the whole
badge is a link when a URL resolves, plain text otherwise. No separate cert-link
line anywhere in the app now.

### PCGS Label Auto-Populate (locked in)
A "PCGS Label #" field (Add Coin, shown only when Grader = `PCGS`, above
Denomination) accepts a scanned/typed PCGS label number in the format
`SPEC.GRADE/CERT` (e.g. `4905.65/12345678`):
- **SPEC** (before the decimal) matches `DB_Coins.PCGS#`.
- **GRADE** (2 digits after the decimal) is the numeric Sheldon grade, 1–70.
- **CERT** (after the slash) is the cert number → becomes `SerNo`, and also
  fills the Cert/Type Number field directly (not left blank for manual re-entry).

Resolution against `DB_Coins.PCGS#`:
- **Zero matches** → leave fields blank, show a non-blocking "PCGS# not found in
  DB_Coins" warning (add manually / research later).
- **Exactly one match** → auto-fill Year, MintMark, Denomination, Description,
  Variety, CoinID, GSID (if populated) onto the All-sheet entry from that row.
- **Multiple matches** (a known `PCGS_Duplicate_Queue` collision) → do NOT
  auto-fill. Show all matching DB_Coins rows (Year/MintMark/Variety/Finish/
  Description) and require the user to tap one before anything is filled. This is
  expected, ordinary behavior for entries still in `PCGS_Duplicate_Queue`, not an
  error state — the app doesn't require that queue to be clean first.

Once a row is resolved: numeric GRADE + that row's `DB_Coins.Finish` convert to the
adjectival Grade via the standard ANA/Sheldon table (`PO-1, FR-2, AG-3, G-4, G-6,
VG-8, VG-10, F-12, F-15, VF-20, VF-25, VF-30, VF-35, XF-40, XF-45, AU-50, AU-53,
AU-55, AU-58`, then 60–70 prefixed by Finish: `Business Strike`→`MS-`,
`Proof`/`Reverse Proof`→`PR-`, `SMS`/`Specimen`→`SP-`). Per the Grade picker's
hyphen standard above, the prefix and number are always joined with a hyphen
(`MS-65`, not `MS65`). GradeSource is set to `PCGS` automatically (it's a
certified grade, not an estimate). SerNo is set to CERT, and the cert-lookup
link is generated via the grader-agnostic `Lookup_Graders` resolver described
above (`https://www.pcgs.com/cert/{CERT}` today, since that's PCGS's base URL
on file) — same hotlink-only approach as the rest of PCGS integration (see
External data sources below), not an API call. Everything else (CollectionID,
Cost, PurchaseDate, Vendor, StorageLocation, etc.) stays manual — this only
fills what the label itself certifies.

### ANACS/ICG/CAC label format (deferred, not started)
PCGS's label format (`SPEC.GRADE/CERT`) is confirmed and spec'd for auto-decode
above. NGC is confirmed to have **no equivalent decodable identity number** —
its cert number is an invoice/sequence ID only, with grade as separate printed
text — so NGC gets normal manual entry (Grade and Cert Number typed as separate
fields), same as any non-decoding grader; this is closed, not worth
re-researching. ANACS, ICG, and CAC/CACG label structures remain **unconfirmed**.
The collection currently has 0 coins graded by any of these three, so there's no
active functional gap — per the standing DB_Coins scope rule (don't research
ahead of need), this waits until a coin graded by one of them is actually
acquired. The cert-lookup link still works for any of these once
`Lookup_Graders` gets a confirmed base URL for it, independent of whether
auto-decode is ever built.

### Needs Attention queue (locked in, renamed from "Needs DB_Coins Entry")
Framed as a general discrepancy-tracking hub — "where any discrepancy gets
identified, worked, and tracked" — not something narrowly scoped to DB_Coins
misses. The only concrete content today is still coins saved without a DB_Coins
match (flagged automatically, shown with a live count badge), and resolution is
unchanged: Claude research + Copilot adds the DB_Coins row. The broader framing
is intentional headroom for other discrepancy types later (nothing else feeds
this queue yet) — don't assume every row is a DB_Coins miss when extending this.

### Stats & Value (locked in)
A dedicated Dashboard tile/tab, not front-loaded cards on the Dashboard itself
(see "App structure" above for that distinction). Shows: total item count (with
a coins-vs-medals breakdown), total spent, total estimated value, net gain/loss,
and a by-Denomination breakdown (count + value, one row per denomination with a
proportional bar). Depends on a new **Cost** field on the All sheet (purchase
price) alongside the existing estimated-value field — needed for the spent/value/
net-gain numbers to mean anything; today's Cost values are placeholder data, not
pulled from the workbook.

## Editing existing coins (bounded)
App CAN write directly to: Grade, GradeSource, SerNo, Designation, Storage Location,
and can attach additional photos/receipts to an existing coin at any time. App CANNOT
do anything requiring research or judgment (new PCGS# lookups, album slot matching,
restructuring, cost allocation) — those stay chat + Copilot tasks. This is the exact
scope of the Edit button on Browse's coin detail view (see "Browse detail view"
above) — it doesn't expose any field beyond this list.

Every app-made write (add or edit) sets a **Reviewed** column on All to
blank/unchecked. A human sets it checked after glancing at it.

## Quick-capture notes → ParkingLot
Floating capture button anywhere in the app (typed or phone dictation). Auto-captures
timestamp, current screen, and CollectionID if one was being viewed. Writes a new
ParkingLot row (same lock/fallback pattern as coin writes): Source, Screen, Related
CollectionID, Status (Open), plus the note text.

## Batch receipt capture
Separate dashboard action from Add Coin. Photographs a receipt, saves to
CoinReceipts with a timestamp name, auto-generates a ParkingLot note pointing at that
exact file. The app cannot reach back into OneDrive on Claude's behalf later — the
photo still has to be manually brought into a chat to actually process it. The note's
job is just making sure nothing gets lost or forgotten, not eliminating that step.

## External data sources — what's safe to hotlink vs. not
- GreatCollections, PCGS, and similar sites generally block cross-origin image
  fetching — don't build automated image pulls from them. Manual save-then-Library-
  upload is the supported path (already works, no new feature needed).
- PCGS has a public REST API but only via OAuth password grant, which would require
  the app to handle Ray's raw PCGS credentials in public client-side code — not
  building this. Use plain hotlink buttons to PCGS's own cert/pop-report/account
  pages instead (Ray logs in directly on PCGS's site, never through this app).
- OneDrive/MSAL uses a proper redirect-based OAuth flow, which is why it's safe —
  Ray's password never touches this app's code. This is NOT true of most other
  services; don't assume another service's login can work the same way without
  checking whether they support a redirect/authorization-code flow first.

## App structure
Single-page app shell, one MSAL redirect URI, internal navigation: Dashboard /
Browse / Albums / Wishlist / Add Coin. Name: "Salty's Cabinet." Batch Receipt,
Stats & Value, and Needs Attention are dashboard-only destinations, not
persistent nav items — the persistent bottom/side nav stays those original five.

Dashboard still has no summary stat cards on the front itself (Total Coins /
Est. Value inline were tried and dropped early on — not useful up front). That's
a different decision from having a **dedicated, opt-in Stats & Value tab**
reachable via a tile (see below) — the tab is fine, front-loading its numbers
onto the Dashboard directly is what was rejected.

Dashboard composition: pending-coin banner (only when one exists), Spotlight,
then a single flat **"Go To" tile grid** — Browse, Albums, Wishlist, Add Coin,
Stats & Value, Batch Receipt, Needs Attention, all as equal tiles. There used to
be a separate "Quick Actions" section below the Go-To grid for Batch
Receipt/Needs Attention — that's gone; everything reachable from the Dashboard
now lives in one grid rather than two visually separate tiers. Needs Attention
carries a live count badge on its tile, same as before.

Wishlist mirrors Browse's grid-then-detail shape: tapping an item opens a detail
view with an editable Notes field (for things like "found one, negotiating
price"), plus Purchase Info and Photos drill-down sections for once Ray's
actually bought it. This does **not** promote/convert a Wishlist item into an
owned coin with a CollectionID — that's a separate, unbuilt feature; the detail
view just lets a want-list entry carry richer information while it's still a
want-list entry.

Device-tiered layout, especially for Albums: phone = simple scrollable list;
tablet = full circular slot grid; desktop = grid with real photos inline.

Albums is a picker first: a list of albums (name + fill-progress bar), tap one to
open its slot detail. Albums render like a physical album page: circular slots,
date/mintmark, mintage number (once populated) even on open holes. No per-album
settings needed — each slot's appearance is automatic per-coin: photo if one
exists, generic icon if owned but unphotographed, dashed outline if an open
want-list hole. **Tapping an open/want slot jumps straight into Add Coin**, with
the album + slot pre-filled (shown via a context banner, and pre-selected in the
Add Coin "Assign to Album" field) — this supersedes the earlier "found it,
pending" toggle idea.

Deferred, not needed for initial build: animated page-flip / two-page desktop
spread (simple instant toggle is enough for now), album cover + historical-info
pages (content-driven, come back to this later).

## What NOT to build
- AI photo pre-fill from receipts/coin photos — shelved permanently. Redundant with
  free chat-based photo analysis Ray already gets through his Pro subscription.
- Batch order entry UI in the app — stays a chat + Copilot workflow.
- Live PCGS account login — see External data sources above.
- localStorage/sessionStorage for anything that matters — use OneDrive as the
  actual store; the app should be re-derivable from OneDrive state at any time.

## Full design history
For the complete session-by-session reasoning behind these decisions, see the
project's Claude.ai knowledge base (Project: "Coin Collection"), particularly
`coin-collection-session-10Jul2026-app-design.md`. This file is the working
summary; that one has the "why."
